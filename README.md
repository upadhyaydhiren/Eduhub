# Eduhub

Background: In India today it is possible to get specific catalogue for almost every domain but when it comes to education do we have simillar availability here too. Why content of premier institute and great scholars is not available to all. Govt. of India launched its great initiative NPTEL but what about domains other than Engineering. Can there be one complete and simple platform to share and contribute intellectual content.

Idea and out solution: Eduhub is a content sharing and professional communication platform to contribute content/explanation in image,text or video format. user can share content related to topics, create new topics and conduct AMAs. Users can view all these content( without login) and search/ask questions. Eduhub will collaborate with multiple platforms like stackoverflow to search questions. 

This platform can be used to find/share content related to any topic
